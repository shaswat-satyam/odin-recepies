        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> Avocados are a must-have staple in my house. In fact, I usually buy 1 or 2 each week to use in all kinds of recipes. Also known as butter fruit, avocados (makhan phal) are a wonderfully fatty and flavorful ingredient thats great to include in both sweet and savory dishes. </p>

        <ul>
            <strong>Ingredients</strong>
            <li> 8 to 10 slices garlic bread</li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li> 1 garlic clove</li>
            <li> 1 avocado</li>
            <li> 1 garlic clove</li>
            <li> 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li> 1/4 teaspoon crushed black pepper</li>
            <li> 1/4 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
            <li> salt as required</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <strong>Steps</strong>
            <li>Firstly slice a garlic loaf or a french bread.</li>
            <li>Then heat a griddle or tawa or skillet. Place the loaf slices on it. Toast them on a low to medium flame.</li>
            <li>Whilst the bread is getting toasted, we prepare the avocado filling. Take an avocado. Rinse if you want. Then give a cut at the center moving around the entire avocado.</li>
            <li>We want the avocado in two halves. Remove the seed.</li>
            <li>With a spoon, scoop out the entire avocado flesh, which is like butter and gets removed easily</li>
            <li>Place the scooped avocado flesh on chopping board and then chop. Or you can mash the avocado pulp in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped avocado in a mixing bowl. Also add 1 small to medium garlic clove (finely chopped or minced)</li>
            <li>Season with Â½ teaspoon oregano (or add as required), crushed black pepper (as required), salt and a few drops of lemon juice. The lemon juice prevents the discoloration.</li>
            <li>Mix Well and keep aside</li>
            <li>Once the slices are toasted then brush some extra virgin olive on top</li>
            <li>Halve a garlic and rub the garlic on all the bread slices</li>
            <li>Now gently place the avocado filling on the toasted bread slices. Sprinkle some red chilli flakes</li>
            <li>Serve avacado toast as soon as you make them.</li>
        </ol>
